# ThingsNotToForget
A list of things I try not to forget to take when I leave the bed/room/house/city/country/continent

Disclaimer: The list was written over the years for my personal usage. It is heavily biased toward things *I* tend to forget. Also, it refers only to things I use (and how/when/where I use them) and does not tend to be universal. If one wants to use it for its personal needs, it will probably needs some adjustment (to adds things I do not need to care about such as pets, kids, specific health issues, etc).

However, the list is released here because:
 - I'm happy to share it with anyone who might find an interest in it
 - public Github repositories are free and more convenient (access and modification) than the other solutions I've been using for now (email drafts, note-taking applications, sheets of papers).
